# 🚜 Bulldozer Price Prediction App  

This project predicts the **auction sale price of bulldozers** using Machine Learning.  
It is based on the [Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers).

# Project Overview
- Built a **Machine Learning model** to predict bulldozer prices.  
- Extracted **time features** (year, month, day, etc.) from sales date.  
- Applied **feature engineering** (handling missing values, categorical encoding).  
- Trained using **Scikit-learn RandomForestRegressor** (or your chosen model).  
- Deployed as an **interactive Streamlit web app**.
